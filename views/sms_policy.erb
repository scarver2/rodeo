<h2>Changes to Messaging Terms</h2>

<h2>Dispute Resolution</h2>
<ol>
	<li>General. In the interest of resolving disputes between you and Texas Embroidery Ranch in the most expedient and cost effective manner, you and Texas Embroidery Ranch agree that any dispute arising out of or in any way related to these messaging terms and conditions ("Messaging Terms") or your receipt of text messages from Texas Embroidery Ranch or its service providers will be resolved by binding arbitration. Arbitration is less formal than a lawsuit in court. Arbitration uses a neutral arbitrator instead of a judge or jury, may allow for more limited discovery than in court, and can be subject to very limited review by courts. Arbitrators can award the same damages and relief that a court can award. This agreement to arbitrate disputes includes all claims arising out of or in any way related to these Messaging Terms, or your receipt of text messages from Texas Embroidery Ranch or its service providers whether based in contract, tort, statute, fraud, misrepresentation, or any other legal theory, and regardless of when a claim arises. YOU UNDERSTAND AND AGREE THAT, BY AGREEING TO THESE MESSAGING TERMS, YOU AND Texas Embroidery Ranch ARE EACH WAIVING THE RIGHT TO A TRIAL BY JURY OR TO PARTICIPATE IN A CLASS ACTION AND THAT THESE MESSAGING TERMS SHALL BE SUBJECT TO AND GOVERNED BY THE FEDERAL ARBITRATION ACT.</li>
	<li>Exceptions. Notwithstanding subsection (1) above, nothing in these Messaging Terms will be deemed to waive, preclude, or otherwise limit the right of you or Texas Embroidery Ranch to: (i) bring an individual action in small claims court; (ii) pursue an enforcement action through the applicable federal, state, or local agency if that action is available; (iii) seek injunctive relief in aid of arbitration from a court of competent jurisdiction; or (iv) file suit in a court of law to address an intellectual property infringement claim.</li>
	<li>Arbitrator. Any arbitration between you and Texas Embroidery Ranch will be governed by the Federal Arbitration Act and the Commercial Dispute Resolution Procedures and Supplementary Procedures for Consumer Related Disputes (collectively, "AAA Rules") of the American Arbitration Association ("AAA"), as modified by these Messaging Terms, and will be administered by the AAA. The AAA Rules and filing forms are available online at www.adr.org, by calling the AAA at 1-800-778-7879, or by contacting Texas Embroidery Ranch. The arbitrator has exclusive authority to resolve any dispute relating to the interpretation, applicability, or enforceability of this binding arbitration agreement.</li>
	<li>Notice; Process. If you or Texas Embroidery Ranch intends to seek arbitration, then the party seeking arbitration must first send a written notice of the dispute to the other party by U.S. Mail ("Notice"). Texas Embroidery Ranch address for Notice is: 2834 Colorado Avenue Suite 100 Santa Monica, CA 90404, Attn: General Counsel with a copy to legal@wearTexas Embroidery Ranch.com. The Notice must: (i) describe the nature and basis of the claim or dispute; and (ii) set forth the specific relief sought ("Demand"). You and Texas Embroidery Ranch will make good faith efforts to resolve the claim directly, but if you and Texas Embroidery Ranch do not reach an agreement to do so within 30 days after the Notice is received, you or Texas Embroidery Ranch may commence an arbitration proceeding. During the arbitration, the amount of any settlement offer made by you or Texas Embroidery Ranch must not be disclosed to the arbitrator until after the arbitrator makes a final decision and award, if any.</li>
	<li>Fees. If you commence arbitration in accordance with these Messaging Terms, Texas Embroidery Ranch will reimburse you for your payment of the filing fee, unless your claim is for more than $15,000 or as set forth below, in which case the payment of any fees will be decided by the AAA Rules. If the claim is for $15,000 or less, you may choose whether the arbitration will be conducted: (i) solely on the basis of documents submitted to the arbitrator; (ii) through a non-appearance based telephone hearing; or (iii) by an in-person hearing as established by the AAA Rules. If the arbitrator finds that either the substance of your claim or the relief sought in the Demand is frivolous or brought for an improper purpose (as measured by the standards set forth in Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 11(b)), then the payment of all fees will be governed by the AAA Rules. In that case, you agree to reimburse Texas Embroidery Ranch for all monies previously disbursed by it that are otherwise your obligation to pay under the AAA Rules. Regardless of the manner in which the arbitration is conducted, the arbitrator must issue a reasoned written decision sufficient to explain the essential findings and conclusions on which the decision and award, if any, are based. You and Texas Embroidery Ranch agree that such written decision, and information exchanged during arbitration, will be kept confidential except to the extent necessary to enforce or permit limited judicial review of the award. The arbitrator may make rulings and resolve disputes as to the payment and reimbursement of fees or expenses at any time during the proceeding and upon request from you or Texas Embroidery Ranch made within 14 days of the arbitrator's ruling on the merits.</li>
	<li>No Class Actions. YOU AND Texas Embroidery Ranch AGREE THAT EACH MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST THE OTHER ONLY IN AN INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING. Further, unless both you and Texas Embroidery Ranch agree otherwise in a signed writing, the arbitrator may not consolidate more than one person's claims, and may not otherwise preside over any form of a representative or class proceeding.</li>
	<li>Modifications to this Arbitration Provision. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in these Messaging Terms, if Texas Embroidery Ranch makes any future change to this arbitration provision, other than a change to Texas Embroidery Ranch address for Notice, you may reject the change by sending us written notice within 30 days of the change to Texas Embroidery Ranch address for Notice, in which case this arbitration provision, as in effect immediately prior to the changes you rejected, will continue to govern any disputes between you and Texas Embroidery Ranch.</li>
	<li>Enforceability. If an arbitrator decides that applicable law precludes enforcement of any of the limitations of subsection (6) above (addressing class, representative and consolidated proceedings) as to a particular claim for relief, then that claim (and only that claim) must be severed from the arbitration and brought in court. If any other provision of these Messaging Terms is found to be unenforceable, the applicable provision shall be deemed stricken and the remainder of these Messaging Terms shall remain in full force and effect.</li>
