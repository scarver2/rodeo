      <h1>About Texas Embroidery Ranch</h1>
      <p class="text-lg text-zinc-200">
        We’re a family-run embroidery and apparel shop built on Texas values: honest work, fair pricing, and results you’ll be proud to wear.

      <h2 id="who-we-are">Who We Are</h2>
      <p>
        Texas Embroidery Ranch is a North Texas embroidery shop serving small businesses, schools, churches, teams, and hardworking folks who need custom gear done right.
        From polos and caps to jackets, patches, and print solutions, we focus on clean results, dependable timelines, and friendly service every step of the way.
      </p>
      <p>
        We believe your logo and your message matter. That’s why we sweat the details—thread choice, stitch density, placement, and finishing—so the final product looks sharp
        and holds up through real life. If you’re building a brand, outfitting a crew, or honoring a milestone, we’re here to help you do it with pride.
      </p>

      <h2 id="family-owned">Family-Owned, Texas Proud</h2>
      <p>
        This business was built the old-fashioned way—one job at a time and one handshake after another. We’re family-owned, and we treat customers like neighbors.
        When you reach out, you’ll get straight answers, clear expectations, and a partner who wants your project to come out right.
      </p>
      <p>
        In January 2025, ownership transitioned to the Carver family, bringing fresh energy and modern workflows while keeping the same down-home standards that earned our reputation.
        In July 2025, we brought the business back to Anna, Texas—right where we belong.
